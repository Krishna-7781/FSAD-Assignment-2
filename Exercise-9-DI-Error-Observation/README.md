Exercise-9 Result:
In this experiment, a dependency injection error was intentionally created by declaring a dependency in the controller without defining the corresponding service bean. When the application was executed, Spring failed to start and displayed an error indicating that the required dependency could not be injected. This error was observed through the console output. The issue was then resolved by creating the missing service class and annotating it as a Spring service bean. After fixing the configuration, the application started successfully and executed as expected, demonstrating how Spring handles dependency injection errors and their resolution.
