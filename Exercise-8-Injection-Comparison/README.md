Exercise-8 Result:
In this experiment, two different dependency injection methods were implemented and compared. In the first implementation, constructor injection was used to inject the RegistrationService into the RegistrationController, and successful object creation and dependency injection were confirmed through constructor-based console messages. In the second implementation, setter injection was applied using the @Autowired annotation on a setter method, and the successful injection and method execution were verified through corresponding console logs. Both implementations were executed independently and produced the expected output, demonstrating the working of constructor and setter injection techniques in Spring.
