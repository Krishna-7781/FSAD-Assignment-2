Exercise-6 Result:
A Spring MVC application was successfully developed to handle an HTTP POST request.
A registration form was created using JSP to collect user input such as student name and course name.
The form data was submitted using the POST method and handled in the controller using @PostMapping.
The submitted values were received using request parameters and displayed on a result page.
The application was deployed successfully on the Apache Tomcat server, and the POST request processing was verified by manually accessing the controller URL.
